Self built c tools to improve productivity 

## JPROTO

Basically proto but better, ig, sorry Duncan :)

Usage, just type 
```jproto filename.c```

it produces filename.h or updates filename.h with the prototypes found in filename.c 

*NOTE:* It is still under development, may cause issues with your code or even cause you to freak out. But remember.... BREATHE IN and BREATHE OUT. Code that is lost is lost :).

Things to still add 
1. Currently the updates dont replace the old prototype, instead it just adds the new one in the bottom. So need to keep track of the function name instad of the entire prototype itself. Or during the lookup to check if it is present, further check if the name is present. If it is, then update it. 

*Currently working on a different project and created this to increase my productivity while creating headers. So would come back to this later :)*
